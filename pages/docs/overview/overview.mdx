# Overview

This is the official documentation hub for Webb developers. This guide is broken down into several sections that explain the principles and design decisions that make up Webb.

Webb is an ecosystem of privacy protocols and products for a multi-chain world. In this site, you can find information about the protocols we are actively building, the dApps we have built, the open-source repos we maintain, and other privacy related research and ideas we aim to integrate into our community.

## Philosophy & Ethos

We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right and that this needs to extend into the blockchain space sooner rather than later. On blockchain platforms today, we continually expose our data when we participate in the myriad of protocols that exist in the multi-chain world. We move assets across chains to buy NFTs, pay our contributors and employees with cryptocurrencies, and generate large amounts of data that can be mined by anyone with an internet connection.

Our mission is to change this by contributing to the growing amount of privacy tools that exist on blockchains today. We are motivated by cross-chain user behavior. Our initial focus is to work on cross-chain privacy.

# Motivation

Privacy is lacking when we move our assets across chain and more generally when we send messages across chains.
At Webb, we are working to increase privacy on cross-chain applications through our private bridge protocol
called the Webb Anchor System.

The Webb Anchor System is an interoperable zero-knowledge proof based system for privately moving assets
between blockchains. We plan to extend this more generally into a cross-chain messaging system with
zero-knowledge based property testing for data stored in the system’s anchors. We use the term anchor to
indicate an endpoint of a bridged system, as anchors are the endpoints of spider webs. The Webb Anchor System
can be visualized like a spider web with anchors on the various blockchains we support.

Currently, the Webb Anchor System enables private asset transfers across EVM chains and Substrate chains
using zero-knowledge proofs and a configurable token re-wrapping system. We are building out this asset
protocol in many languages and environments, namely:

- [Solidity smart contracts](https://github.com/webb-tools/protocol-solidity)
- [Substrate Pallets](https://github.com/webb-tools/protocol-substrate)
- [Ink! smart contracts](https://github.com/webb-tools/protocol-ink)
- [CosmWasm smart contracts](https://github.com/webb-tools/protocol-cosmwasm)

We plan to extend this into the Solana ecosystems once we deploy our first few products.
