# Tangle Network Launch

 Here you'll find all the information on the Tangle Network launch.

## Launch Date

Our official launch date is yet to be announced, stay tuned for the exciting date!

## Participation

There are many ways to participate in the Tangle Network:

1. **Run a Node**: Check our [Node Operation Guide](/docs/ecosystem-roles/role-overview/) for instructions.
2. **Develop a Dapp**: Tangle Network is EVM compatible, meaning that your existing dapps should work with minimal to no changes on our network. We'll have a guide up soon for Dapp Development.
3. **Contribute to the Codebase**: Our project is open source, and we welcome contributions! See our [Contribution Guide](/docs/contribute) for details.

## Genesis Block

The genesis block, represented as a chainspec in Substrate, represents the start of the Tangle Network. It contains the initial state of the network, including the first set of validators, the initial supply of our native token, and more. Our recommendation is still being developed.

## Post-Launch

After the launch, our work doesn't stop. We'll continue to maintain and improve the network, implementing governance proposals, and working with our community to ensure the Tangle Network is secure, robust, and meets the needs of its users.
