# Signature Relaying

If you wish to only support certain functions within the relayer network you can configure the relayer to only support those functions.
For instance, you can turn off governance relaying and data querying and only relay private transactions. It is important to note
that governace relaying, private transaction relaying and data querying are all on by default.

To set up the relayer exclusively for data proposing and signature relaying we need to add the following fields to under the
`[evm.<network>.contracts]` section:

### Required Fields

- **`contract`**: Name of the contract to support (e.g. "VAnchor", "SignatureBridge")
- **`address`**: Address of the contract
- **`events-watcher`**: Event watcher should be set to `true` for this strategy and include a specified polling interval
- **`proposal-signing-backend`**: Indicates how proposals are signed (e.g. "Mocked", "DKG")
- **`linked-anchors`**: Entries for this anchor contract's connected edges. These fields are used to determine the generation of AnchorUpdate proposals

Under the `[features]` section we need to turn off data-querying and private-relaying.

- **`data-query`**: Should be set to `false` for this strategy
- **`governance-relay`**: Should be set to `true` for this strategy (set to `true` by default)
- **`private-relay`**: Should be set to `false` for this strategy

An example configuration file for the Goerli network that is configured for governance relaying:

<Callout type="info">
  You will need to update the linked-anchors and contract addresses for the applicable chains.
</Callout>

```
[[evm.goerli.contracts]]
contract = "VAnchor"
address = "0x03b88eD9Ff9bE84e4baD3F55D67AE5ABA610523C"
events-watcher = { enabled = true, polling-interval = 10000 }
proposal-signing-backend = { type = "DKG", private-key = "$GOVERNOR_PRIVATE_KEY" }
linked-anchors = [
  { chain = "ropsten", chain-id = "3", address = "0x66e04f6ae26c310e39f5bf24d873909e6d3b64c7" },
  { chain = "rinkeby", chain-id = "4", address = "0x91127f21d63029eb5b2de05b4b1e9fd3497ee95b"},
  { chain = "polygontestnet", chain-id = "80001", address = "0x1371efed369498718bee3eb5d58e5d3dec86be85" },
  { chain = "optimismtestnet", chain-id = "69", address = "0x5353cede4b8fea148fb1f66f45d3ec27bff2224d" },
  { chain = "arbitrumtestnet", chain-id = "421611",  address = "0x4953110789d0cb6de126f4ea88890670ccfe6906" },
]
