# Managing Notes

For each deposit, transfer, and withdraw a note is generated to represent a user balance. For Webb's Minerva Bridge
we make use of the UTXO model for handling user balances. Each note contains the following attributes:

- the protocol name (e.g. `vanchor`),
- private key,
- blinding value,
- merkle path index,
- chainID,
- public key,
- commitment,
- nullifer,
- a value that represents the amount of funds that can be spent and effectively transferred to another user

An example note may look similar to the following:

```
webb://v1:vanchor/1099522782887:1099522782887/0x965c94a6e1b713e751164d2ba09aa0306f48ee74:0x965c94a6e1b713e751164d2ba09aa0306f48ee74/0000010000aa36a7:0000000000000000003c6568f12e8000:1d81f339efc951a8d19133c4a050159662b28d4021e75c66af29cb93f427b331:003feb82b9da3e335d6312f94670ea0317035d34c4addb31fad674af1f4c8059/?curve=Bn254&width=5&exp=5&hf=Poseidon&backend=Circom&token=webbETH&denom=18&amount=17000000000000000
```

These notes are intended to be kept in confidence, anyone who gains access to your notes can withdraw your funds from
the Minerva Bridge. Your notes are stored locally as you transact through this application as well as encrypted on-chain
for persistent storage. The below guide provides a walkthrough of how to manage your notes.

## Shielded Assets Table

Once you have made deposit(s) into the Minerva Bridge we conveniently populate the Shielded Assets table with the
relevant data points of all your notes.

<br />

<ShieldedAssets />

The columns of the above pictured table represent the following:

- **Chain:** the destination chain that the shielded assets may be withdrawn from
- **ShieledAsset:** the name of the shielded asset that you have claim to in the pool
- **Composition:** the configuration of tokens that make up the pool in which your shielded assets exist in
- **Available Balance:** the total sum of available balance to be withdrawn across all your notes for that given shielded asset
- **Note Found:** the sum of all notes for a given shielded asset
- **Action:** quick action shortcuts user can make use of for transfer and withdraw

The shielded asset table provides you with a holistic view of your various shielded assets that exist within the Minerva Bridge.

## Available Spend Notes Table

For every transact you have done with the Minerva Bridge a note is generated. The Available Spend table provides a record of each
your notes so you can conveniently access and view these notes along with relevant data. Simply the table provides a list
of your own available spend notes.

<AvailableSpendNotes />

The columns of the above pictured table represent the following:

- **Chain:** the destination chain that the shielded assets may be withdrawn from
- **ShieledAsset:** the name of the shielded asset that you have claim to in the pool
- **Composition:** the configuration of tokens that make up the pool in which your shielded assets exist in
- **Available Balance:** the available balance to be withdrawn for the given shielded asset
- **Subsequent Deposits:** the number of deposits that occurred after your own deposit. The more deposits that occurred subsequently to your own the greater the privacy achieved.
- **Note:** the actual note representing your claim to your deposited amount

The available spend table provides you with a holistic view of each of your available spend notes.

Selecting the chevron icon next to your note will display a dropdown menu for quick action shortcuts user can make use of for transfer and withdraw.
