# Accounts on Minerva Bridge

The Minerva Bridge dApp allows users to manage their notes with an easy to use interface. Prior to depositing 
into the bridge, users are required to create a `NoteAccount`. The `NoteAccount` is easily created by having the user
sign a message using their MetaMask account. More precisely, the MetaMask `NoteAccount` uses the first 32 bytes of the signed message 
from the MetaMask account as the secret seed. It is with this keypair that users are able to fetch, spend, and manage their 
notes right from the interface! 

## Creating a MetaMask `NoteAccount`

The first step to interacting with the bridge dApp is to connect a MetaMask wallet and create a `NoteAccount` using your preferred 
MetaMask account. The below steps outline how go about creating an `NoteAccount`.

**1. Connect MetaMask Wallet**

When you enter the bridge you will be greeted with the following screen. The bottom buttom indicates that you are required to 
connect a wallet. 

<ConnectWallet />

**2. Select Source Chain**

Upon selecting the 'Connect Wallet' button, you will be asked to select a source chain, 
this will be the act as the source chain for the subsuqent deposit. 

<br />

<SelectSourceChain /> 

**3. Select Wallet to Connect** 

After selecting the active chain, you will be prompted to connect to your desired wallet provider. 
For the purposes of this walkthrough we will utilize MetaMask. Select MetaMask and wait to be prompted 
by your MetaMask extension. If you do not have MetaMask installed, you will need to install it prior to 
depositing into the bridge.

<WalletComponent />

**4. Creating Note Account** 

Once connected to your MetaMask account, you will need to create a NoteAccount using the connect MetaMask account. 
To do so, select the 'Create Note Account' button as shown below. 

<br />

<CreateNoteAccount />

Once selected you will be prompted to agree to Webb's terms and conditions. Select the confirm checkbox, followed with 
'Create Note Account' 

<br />

<CreateNoteAccountPrompt />

**5. Sign MetaMask Message** 

Upon selecting to 'Create Note Account', users will be prompted by MetaMask to sign a message from Webb. As mentioned above, 
we use the first 32 bytes of the signed message from the MetaMask account as the secret seed to create the `NoteAccount` keypair. 

<br />

<SignatureRequestPrompt />

Once signed, you will be able to 'Get Started' with interacting with Webb's Minerva Bridge! 

Now that you have created a `NoteAccount` you can make a deposit into the bridge, view, and manage all your notes from the interface!
