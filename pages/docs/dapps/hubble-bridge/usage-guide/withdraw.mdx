# Withdrawals on Hubble Bridge

This guide will provide a step-by-step process to assist in making a withdraw on the Hubble Bridge.

## Withdrawal Inputs

You have made an deposit on the bridge and are now ready to withdraw from the shielded pool. It is important to note
to protect and preserve your privacy you should wait some time for subsequent deposits to be made prior to withdrawing
your funds. This will ensure that your withdrawal transaction is not linked to your deposit transaction.

You will notice the **Withdraw** button to be disabled initially. We must provide the details of our transaction
before we can withdraw.

<br />

<Withdraw />

### **1. Select Appropiate Chain**

To get started we want to make sure we are connected to the correct chain. The correct chain is the chain that we
indicated as a our destination chain during the deposit. If you are not connected to the correct chain you will
notice that if we try to withdraw it will indicate an insuffient balance error.

To see the destination chain of your previous deposits, just scroll down to the **Available Spend Notes** tab to view the
note and its destination chain.

### **2. Select Token**

Once you have selected the correct chain we will need to select what token to withdraw from the shielded pool. Clicking
on the token selection component will display a list of tokens. Select the token that is represented in the note.

<WithdrawToken />

### **3. Unwrap and Withdraw**

When we make a deposit on the Hubble bridge the depositing asset is wrapped into a Webb based asset. Thus, during the
withdraw process we can either unwrap the asset into a supported underlying asset of the specified shielded pool or we can
withdraw the Webb wrapped asset as is (e.g. `WebbETH`).

Be advised in order to unwrap and withdraw the underlying asset there must be sufficient liquidity on the destination chain. Otherwise,
you will be required to withdraw the Webb wrapped asset as is or wait for sufficient liquidity on that particular chain. That does **not** mean you are unable to unwrap and withdraw the underlying asset completely, only
that you will need to withdraw the Webb wrapped asset and then perform a separate transaction to unwrap the asset on a destination chain that has sufficient liquidity if you
want to withdraw the underlying asset (e.g. `ETH`).

To begin with the unwrap and withdraw process, toggle the **Unwrap and Withdraw** switch. This will display the unwrap and withdraw option within the withdraw component.
Next, select the token you would like to unwrap from by clicking on the **Select Unwrapping Asset** component.

<br />
<UnwrapWithdrawStart />

Select the token you would like to unwrap from the list of tokens. The tokens listed will only be the tokens that are supported.

<br />
<UnwrapWithdrawToken />

In the below example, we are attempting to unwrap `WebbETH` into `ETH`. That is, once we complete the withdraw process we will receive `ETH` on the destination chain.

<br />
<UnwrapWithdraw />

### **4. Input Amount**

With the Hubble bridge you can withdraw variable amounts, however, users are encouraged to withdraw fixed amounts to further protect their privacy and the privacy of the
protocol as a whole. Nonetheless the dApp supports withdrawing both fixed and variable amounts.

#### Fixed Amount

To withdraw a fixed amount simply select an amount outlined within the dApp.

<br />
<WithdrawFixedAmount />

#### Custom Amount

To withdraw a custom amount user will need to hover on the chevron icon to the right of **Fixed Amount**. This will display a pop up where you can proceed to
select **Custom Amount**.

<br />
<WithdrawCustomAmount />
<br />

Once you have selected **Custom Amount** you will be able to input the amount you would like to withdraw.

<br />
<WithdrawInputAmount />

### **5. Select Relayer**

For maximum privacy it is recommended to make use of a relayer to perform the transaction. The relayer will be the one to submit the transaction to the chain and send the funds to the recipient address.
To select a relayer, select the **Add a relayer** component which will display a list of relayers that are supported. The decision of which relayer to use is up to the user, and will primarily be
made based on the relayers advertised commission fee. Proceed to select a supported relayer to continue.

<br />
<RelayerSelection />

### **6. Input Recipient Address**

The recipient address is the address that the funds will be sent to. The recipient address can be any address supported on the destination chain. To maximize the privacy of your transaction it
is recommended to use a new address for each transaction.

<br />
<WithdrawRecipient />

## Confirming Withdraw Details

Upon clicking the **Withdraw** button you will be presented with the details of your transaction. It is important to
review these transaction details to ensure they're accurate.

### **1. Verify Withdraw Details**

Review the transaction details of the withdrawal. Pay close attention to the recipient address you have provided and ensure its accuracy.

<br />
<ConfirmWithdraw />

### **2. Withdrawal In-Progress**

Before the withdraw transaction can be completed we transition through the following stages:

- Fetching transaction leaves
- Generate zero knowledge proof
- Send transaction to recipient address

You may observe the progress of each stage within the withdraw in-progress view. If you would like to proceed with
an additional transaction you can click **New Transaction** and begin on your next transaction. The Hubble dApp
conveniently keeps a notification card with transaction details and progress on the right side to keep you informed
when the transaction is successful.

<br />

<WithdrawInProgress />

### **3. Confirm Change Note is Copied**

Within the withdraw in-progress view, you will need to confirm that you have copied the change note. A change note is a new note generated from your remaining balance. The change note should
be kept in confidence as anyone who gains access to the note will be able to withdraw your funds from the
bridge. Your notes are stored locally as you transact through this application as well as encrypted on-chain for persistent storage.

### **4. Successful Withdraw**

When the withdraw transaction is completed you can observe a successful confetti filled message in the notification card!
If you want to see the transaction in a block explorer, click on the **Successfully Withdraw** link within the
notification card.
