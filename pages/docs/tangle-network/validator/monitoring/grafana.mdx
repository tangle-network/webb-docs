# Grafana Setup

The following is a guide outlining the steps to setup Grafana Dashboard to visualize metric data for a Tangle node. If you do not have Tangle node setup yet, please
review the **Tangle Node Quickstart** setup guide [here](/docs/ecosystem-roles/validator/quickstart/).

In this guide we will configure the following modules to visualize metric data from a running Tangle node.

- **Grafana** is the visual dashboard tool that we access from the outside (through SSH tunnel to keep the node secure).

## What are Grafana Dashboards?

A dashboard is a set of one or more panels organized and arranged into one or more rows. Grafana ships with a variety of panels making it easy to
construct the right queries, and customize the visualization so that you can create the perfect dashboard for your need. Each panel can interact
with data from any configured Grafana data source. To learn more about Grafana Dashboards, please
visit the official docs site [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/).

### Getting Started

Let's first start by downloading the latest releases of the above mentioned modules (Grafana).

<Callout type="info">
  This guide assumes the user has root access to the machine running the Tangle node, and following the below steps inside that machine. As well as,
  the user has already configured Prometheus on this machine.
</Callout>

**1. Download Grafana**

<Tabs items={["darwin", "linux"]} storageKey="selected-arch-release">
  <Tab>

    ```sh filename="brew" copy
    brew update
    brew install grafana
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    ```sh filename="linux" copy
    sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
    sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common wget
    wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

    For other linux distrubutions please visit official release page [here](https://grafana.com/grafana/download?edition=oss&platform=linux).

**2. Add Grafana repository to APT sources:**

<Callout type="info">
  This guide assumes the user is installing and configuring Grafana for a linux machine. For Macos instructions 
  please visit the offical docs [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/v9.0/setup-grafana/installation/mac/).
</Callout>

```sh filename="add-apt" copy
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"
```

**3. Refresh your APT cache to update your package lists:**

```sh filename="apt update" copy
sudo apt update
```

**4. Next, make sure Grafana will be installed from the Grafana repository:**

```sh filename="apt-cache" copy
apt-cache policy grafana
```

The output of the previous command tells you the version of Grafana that you are about to install, and where you will retrieve the package from. Verify that the installation candidate at the top of the list will come from the official Grafana repository at `https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb`.

```sh filename="output"
Output of apt-cache policy grafana
grafana:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 6.3.3
  Version table:
     6.3.3 500
        500 https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable/main amd64 Packages
...
```

**5. You can now proceed with the installation:**

```sh filename="install grafana" copy
sudo apt install grafana
```

**6. Install the Alert manager plugin for Grafana:**

```sh filename="grafana-cli" copy
sudo grafana-cli plugins install camptocamp-prometheus-alertmanager-datasource
```

## Service Setup

### Grafana

The Grafana’s service is automatically created during extraction of the deb package, you do not need to create it manually.

Launch a daemon reload to take the services into account in systemd:

```sh filename="daemon-reload" copy
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

**Start the Grafana service:**

```sh filename="start service" copy
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
```

And check that they are working fine, one by one:

```sh filename="status" copy
systemctl status grafana-server
```

If everything is working adequately, activate the services!

```sh filename="enable" copy
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
```

## Run Grafana dashboard

Now we are going to setup the dashboard to visiualize the metrics we are capturing.

From the browser on your local machine, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login`. You should be greeted with
a login screen. You can login with the default credentials, `admin/admin`. Be sure to update your password afterwards.

<Callout type="info">
  This guide assumes the user has configured Prometheus, AlertManager, and Loki as a data source.
</Callout>

**Next, we need to add Prometheus as a data source.**

1. Open the Settings menu
2. Select **Data Sources**
3. Select **Add Data Source**
4. Select Prometheus
5. Input the URL field with http://localhost:9090
6. Click Save & Test

**Next, we need to add AlertManager as a data source.**

1. Open the Settings menu
2. Select **Data Sources**
3. Select **Add Data Source**
4. Select AlertManager
5. Input the URL field with http://localhost:9093
6. Click Save & Test

**Next, we need to add Loki as a data source.**

1. Open the Settings menu
2. Select **Data Sources**
3. Select **Add Data Source**
4. Select Loki
5. Input the URL field with http://localhost:3100
6. Click Save & Test

We have our data sources connected, now its time to import the dashboard we want to use. You may
create your own or import others, but the purposes of this guide we will use the Polkadot Essentials dashboard created
by bLD nodes!

**To import a dashboard:**

1. Select the + button
2. Select **Import**
3. Input the dashboard number, **13840**
4. Select Prometheus and AlertManager as data sources from the dropdown menu
5. Click Load

**In the dashboard selection, make sure you select:**

- **Chain Metrics**: substrate
- **Chain Instance Host**: localhost:9615 to point the chain data scrapper
- **Chain Process Name**: the name of your node binary

Congratulations!! You have now configured Grafana to visualize the metrics we are capturing. You now
have monitoring setup for your node!
