# Alert Manager Setup

The following is a guide outlining the steps to setup AlertManager to send alerts when a Tangle node or DKG is being disrupted. If you do not have Tangle node setup yet, please
review the **How to run an Tangle node** setup guide [here](https://docs.webb.tools/v1/node-operators/run-tangle-node).

In this guide we will configure the following modules to send alerts from a running Tangle node.

- **Alert Manager** listens to Prometheus metrics and pushes an alert as soon as a threshold is crossed (CPU % usage for example).

## What is Alert Manager?

The Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping,
and routing them to the correct receiver integration such as email, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie. It also takes care of silencing and
inhibition of alerts. To learn more about Alertmanager, please
visit the official docs site [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/).

### Getting Started

Let's first start by downloading the latest releases of the above mentioned modules (Alertmanager).

<Callout type="info">
  This guide assumes the user has root access to the machine running the Tangle node, and following the below steps inside that machine. As well as,
  the user has already configured Prometheus on this machine.
</Callout>

**1. Download Alertmanager**

<Tabs items={["darwin", "linux", "windows"]} storageKey="selected-arch-release">
  <Tab>

    AMD version:
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases/download/v0.24.0/alertmanager-0.24.0.darwin-amd64.tar.gz
    ```
    ARM version:
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases/download/v0.24.0/alertmanager-0.24.0.darwin-arm64.tar.gz
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    AMD version:
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases/download/v0.24.0/alertmanager-0.24.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```
    ARM version:
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases/download/v0.24.0/alertmanager-0.24.0.linux-arm64.tar.gz &&
    ```

    For other linux distrubutions please visit official release page [here](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases).

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    AMD version:
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases/download/v0.24.0/alertmanager-0.24.0.windows-amd64.tar.gz
    ```
    ARM version:
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases/download/v0.24.0/alertmanager-0.24.0.windows-arm64.tar.gz
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**2. Extract the Downloaded Files:**

Run the following command:

```
tar xvf alertmanager-*.tar.gz
```

**3. Copy the Extracted Files into `/usr/local/bin`:**

<Callout type="info">
  **Note:** The example below makes use of the `linux-amd64` installations, please update to make use of the target system you have installed.
</Callout>

Copy the `alertmanager` binary and `amtool`:

```
sudo cp ./alertmanager-*.linux-amd64/alertmanager /usr/local/bin/ &&
sudo cp ./alertmanager-*.linux-amd64/amtool /usr/local/bin/
```

**4. Create Dedicated Users:**

Now we want to create dedicated users for the Alertmanager module we have installed:

```
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin alertmanager
```

**5. Create Directories for `Alertmanager`:**

```
sudo mkdir /etc/alertmanager &&
sudo mkdir /var/lib/alertmanager
```

**6. Change the Ownership for all Directories:**

We need to give our user permissions to access these directories:

**alertManager**:

```
sudo chown alertmanager:alertmanager /etc/alertmanager/ -R &&
sudo chown alertmanager:alertmanager /var/lib/alertmanager/ -R &&
sudo chown alertmanager:alertmanager /usr/local/bin/alertmanager &&
sudo chown alertmanager:alertmanager /usr/local/bin/amtool
```

**7. Finally, let's clean up these directories:**

```
rm -rf ./alertmanager*
```

Great! You have now installed and setup your environment. The next series of steps will be configuring the service.

## Configuration

If you are interested to see how we configure the Tangle Network nodes for monitoring check out https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle/tree/main/monitoring.

### Prometheus

The first thing we need to do is add `rules.yml` file to our Prometheus configuration:

Let’s create the `rules.yml` file that will give the rules for Alert manager:

```
sudo touch /etc/prometheus/rules.yml
sudo nano /etc/prometheus/rules.yml
```

We are going to create 2 basic rules that will trigger an alert in case the instance is down or the CPU usage crosses 80%.
You can create all kinds of rules that can triggered, for an exhausted list of rules see our rules list [here](https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle/blob/main/monitoring/prometheus/rules.yml).

Add the following lines and save the file:

```
groups:
  - name: alert_rules
    rules:
      - alert: InstanceDown
        expr: up == 0
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Instance $labels.instance down"
          description: "[{{ $labels.instance }}] of job [{{ $labels.job }}] has been down for more than 1 minute."
 
      - alert: HostHighCpuLoad
        expr: 100 - (avg by(instance)(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[2m])) * 100) > 80
        for: 0m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: Host high CPU load (instance bLd Kusama)
          description: "CPU load is > 80%\n  VALUE = {{ $value }}\n  LABELS: {{ $labels }}"
```

The criteria for triggering an alert are set in the `expr:` part. You can customize these triggers as you see fit.

Then, check the rules file:

```
promtool check rules /etc/prometheus/rules.yml
```

And finally, check the Prometheus config file:

```
promtool check config /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

### Gmail setup

We can use a Gmail address to send the alert emails. For that, we will need to generate an app password from our Gmail account.

Note: we recommend you here to use a dedicated email address for your alerts. Review Google's own guide for
proper set up [here](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en).

### Slack notifications

We can also utilize Slack notifications to send the alerts through. For that we need to a specific slack channel to send the notifications to, and
to install Incoming WebHooks slack application.

To do so, navigate to:

1. Administration > Manage Apps.
2. Search for "Incoming Webhooks"
3. Install into your Slack workspace.

### Alertmanager

The Alert manager config file is used to set the external service that will be called when an alert is triggered. Here, we are going to use the Gmail and Slack notification created previously.

Let’s create the file:

```
sudo touch /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml
sudo nano /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml
```

And add the Gmail configuration to it and save the file:

```
global:
 resolve_timeout: 1m
 
route:
 receiver: 'gmail-notifications'
 
receivers:
- name: 'gmail-notifications'
  email_configs:
  - to: 'EMAIL-ADDRESS'
    from: 'EMAIL-ADDRESS'
    smarthost: 'smtp.gmail.com:587'
    auth_username: 'EMAIL-ADDRESS'
    auth_identity: 'EMAIL-ADDRESS'
    auth_password: 'EMAIL-ADDRESS'
    send_resolved: true
 
 
# ********************************************************************************************************************************************
# Alert Manager for Slack Notifications  *
# ********************************************************************************************************************************************
 
 global:
   resolve_timeout: 1m
   slack_api_url: 'INSERT SLACK API URL'
 
 route:
   receiver: 'slack-notifications'
 
 receivers:
 - name: 'slack-notifications'
   slack_configs:
   - channel: 'channel-name'
     send_resolved: true
     icon_url: https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3380462
     title: |-
      [{{ .Status | toUpper }}{{ if eq .Status "firing" }}:{{ .Alerts.Firing | len }}{{ end }}] {{ .CommonLabels.alertname }} for {{ .CommonLabels.job }}
      {{- if gt (len .CommonLabels) (len .GroupLabels) -}}
        {{" "}}(
        {{- with .CommonLabels.Remove .GroupLabels.Names }}
          {{- range $index, $label := .SortedPairs -}}
            {{ if $index }}, {{ end }}
            {{- $label.Name }}="{{ $label.Value -}}"
          {{- end }}
        {{- end -}}
        )
      {{- end }}
     text: >-
      {{ range .Alerts -}}
      *Alert:* {{ .Annotations.title }}{{ if .Labels.severity }} - `{{ .Labels.severity }}`{{ end }}
      *Description:* {{ .Annotations.description }}
      *Details:*
        {{ range .Labels.SortedPairs }} • *{{ .Name }}:* `{{ .Value }}`
        {{ end }}
      {{ end }}
```

Of course, you have to change the email addresses and the auth_password with the one generated from Google previously.

## Service Setup

### Alert manager

Create and open the Alert manager service file:

```
sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/alertmanager.service &&
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/alertmanager.service
```

Add the following lines:

```
[Unit]
  Description=AlertManager Server Service
  Wants=network-online.target
  After=network-online.target
 
[Service]
  User=alertmanager
  Group=alertmanager
  Type=simple
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/alertmanager \
  --config.file /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml \
  --storage.path /var/lib/alertmanager \
  --web.external-url=http://localhost:9093 \
  --cluster.advertise-address='0.0.0.0:9093'
 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Starting the Services

Launch a daemon reload to take the services into account in systemd:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Next, we will want to start the alertManager service:

**alertManager**:

```
sudo systemctl start alertmanager.service
```

And check that they are working fine:

**alertManager**::

```
systemctl status alertmanager.service
```

If everything is working adequtely, activate the services!

**alertManager**:

```
sudo systemctl enable alertmanager.service
```

Amazing! We have now successfully added alert monitoring for our Tangle node!
