# Prometheus Setup

The following is a guide outlining the steps to setup Prometheus to monitor a Tangle node. If you do not have Tangle node setup yet, please
review the **How to run an Tangle node** setup guide [here](https://docs.webb.tools/v1/node-operators/run-tangle-node). It is important to note that
this guide's purpose is to help you get started with monitoring your Tangle node, not to advise on how to setup a node securely. Please
take additional security and privacy measures into consideration.

In this guide we will configure the following modules to scrape metrics from the running Tangle node.

- **Prometheus** is the central module; it pulls metrics from different sources to provide them to the Grafana dashboard and Alert Manager.
- **Node exporter** provides hardware metrics of the dashboard.
- **Process exporter** provides processes metrics for the dashboard (optional).

## What is Prometheus?

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012,
many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active developer and user community.
It is now a standalone open source project and maintained independently of any company. To learn more about Prometheus, please
visit the official docs site [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/).

### Getting Started

Let's first start by downloading the latest releases of the above mentioned modules (Prometheus, Process exporter, and Node exporter).

**3. Download Process Exporter**

<Tabs items={["linux"]} storageKey="selected-arch-release">
  <Tab>

    AMD version:
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter/releases/download/v0.7.10/process-exporter-0.7.10.linux-amd64.tar.gz

**4. Extract the Downloaded Files:**

Run the following command:

```
tar xvf prometheus-*.tar.gz &&
tar xvf node_exporter-*.tar.gz &&
tar xvf process-exporter-*.tar.gz
```

**5. Copy the Extracted Files into `/usr/local/bin`:**

<Callout type="info">
  **Note:** The example below makes use of the `linux-amd64` installations, please update to make use of the target system you have installed.
</Callout>

We are first going to copy the `prometheus` binary:

```
sudo cp ./prometheus-*.linux-amd64/prometheus /usr/local/bin/
```

Next, we are going to copy over the `prometheus` console libraries:

```
sudo cp -r ./prometheus-*.linux-amd64/consoles /etc/prometheus &&
sudo cp -r ./prometheus-*.linux-amd64/console_libraries /etc/prometheus
```

We are going to do the same with `node-exporter` and `process-exporter`:

```
sudo cp ./node_exporter-*.linux-amd64/node_exporter /usr/local/bin/ &&
sudo cp ./process-exporter-*.linux-amd64/process-exporter /usr/local/bin/
```

**6. Create Dedicated Users:**

Now we want to create dedicated users for each of the modules we have installed:

```
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin prometheus &&
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin node_exporter &&
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin process-exporter
```

**7. Create Directories for `Prometheus`, and `Process exporter`:**

```
sudo mkdir /var/lib/prometheus &&
sudo mkdir /etc/process-exporter
```

**8. Change the Ownership for all Directories:**

We need to give our user permissions to access these directories:

**prometheus**:

```
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/ -R &&
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus/ -R &&
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus
```

**node_exporter**:

```
sudo chown node_exporter:node_exporter /usr/local/bin/node_exporter
```

**process-exporter**:

```
sudo chown process-exporter:process-exporter /etc/process-exporter -R &&
sudo chown process-exporter:process-exporter /usr/local/bin/process-exporter
```

**9. Finally, let's clean up these directories:**

```
rm -rf ./prometheus* &&
rm -rf ./node_exporter* &&
rm -rf ./process-exporter*
```

Great! You have now installed and setup your environment. The next series of steps will be configuring each service.

## Configuration

If you are interested to see how we configure the Tangle Network nodes for monitoring check out https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle/tree/main/monitoring.

### Prometheus

Let’s edit the Prometheus config file and add all the modules in it:

```
sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

Add the following code to the file and save:

```
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

rule_files:
  - 'rules.yml'

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
  - static_configs:
    - targets:
      - localhost:9093

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
  - job_name: "substrate_node"
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9615"]
  - job_name: "node_exporter"
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9100"]
  - job_name: "process-exporter"
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9256"]
```

- **scrape_interval** defines how often Prometheus scrapes targets, while evaluation_interval controls how often the software will evaluate rules.
- **rule_files** set the location of Alert manager rules we will add next.
- **alerting** contains the alert manager target.
- **scrape_configs** contain the services Prometheus will monitor.

You can notice the first scrap where Prometheus monitors itself.

### Process exporter

Process exporter needs a config file to be told which processes they should take into account:

```
sudo touch /etc/process-exporter/config.yml
sudo nano /etc/process-exporter/config.yml
```

Add the following code to the file and save:

```
process_names:
  - name: "{{.Comm}}"
    cmdline:
    - '.+'
```

## Service Setup

### Prometheus

Create and open the Prometheus service file:

```
sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service &&
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
```

Add the following lines:

```
[Unit]
  Description=Prometheus Monitoring
  Wants=network-online.target
  After=network-online.target

[Service]
  User=prometheus
  Group=prometheus
  Type=simple
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
  --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
  --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
  --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries
  ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

[Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Node exporter

Create and open the Node exporter service file:

```
sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service &&
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service
```

Add the following lines:

```
[Unit]
  Description=Node Exporter
  Wants=network-online.target
  After=network-online.target

[Service]
  User=node_exporter
  Group=node_exporter
  Type=simple
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter

[Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Process exporter

Create and open the Process exporter service file:

```
sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/process-exporter.service &&
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/process-exporter.service
```

Add the following lines:

```
[Unit]
  Description=Process Exporter
  Wants=network-online.target
  After=network-online.target

[Service]
  User=process-exporter
  Group=process-exporter
  Type=simple
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/process-exporter \
  --config.path /etc/process-exporter/config.yml

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Starting the Services

Launch a daemon reload to take the services into account in systemd:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Next, we will want to start each service:

**prometheus**:

```
sudo systemctl start prometheus.service
```

**node_exporter**:

```
sudo systemctl start node_exporter.service
```

**process-exporter**:

```
sudo systemctl start process-exporter.service
```

And check that they are working fine:

**prometheus**:

```
systemctl status prometheus.service
```

**node_exporter**:

```
systemctl status node_exporter.service
```

**process-exporter**:

```
systemctl status process-exporter.service
```

If everything is working adequtely, activate the services!

**prometheus**:

```
sudo systemctl enable prometheus.service
```

**node_exporter**:

```
sudo systemctl enable node_exporter.service
```

**process-exporter**:

```
sudo systemctl enable process-exporter.service
```

Amazing! We have now completely setup our Prometheus monitoring and are scraping metrics from our
running Tangle node.

You can view those metrics on the Prometheus dashboard by going to `http://localhost:9090/metrics` !
