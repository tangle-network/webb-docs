## Launching Developers: Webb
Webb is a team of privacy enthusiasts working to develop tools to maintain privacy in the digital space.

### Ethos

At Webb, we regard privacy as a fundamental human right. As we increasingly participate in the multi-chain world, from transferring assets to buying NFTs, it becomes crucial that our activities are not exposed to just **anyone with an internet connection,** just as our day-to-day activities are private to the world. Webb is dedicated to changing this status quo by building and contributing to privacy tools for blockchains.

### Mission

Webb's primary goal is to improve privacy, particularly focusing on cross-chain activities. The majority of our efforts are directed toward developing our private bridge protocol, the Webb Anchor System, and the Tangle Network, a decentrally-governed platform for cross-chain zero-knowledge Applications, as well as several other protocols and tools that are entered into the open-source ecosystem for the use and research of all.

### Webb's Founder: Drew Stone

Drew Stone, the founder of Webb Protocol, has been founding companies in crypto since 2018. He brings a diverse and rich history of technology-focused ventures to the table.

Drew holds a Master's degree in Mathematics and a BSE from the University of Pennsylvania.
