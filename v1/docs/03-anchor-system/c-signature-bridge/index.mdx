The purpose of the signature bridge is many-fold:

1. Verification of message signatures by the DKG
2. Executing the message's execution data through the respective **Handler**.
3. Setting new resource IDs to their **Handlers**.

## API

A signature bridge should support a simple API for setting resource IDs and executing proposals:

- `adminSetResourceWithSignature` - sets a new resource ID mapping to its respective **Handler**.
- `executeProposalWithSignature` - verifies the proposal's signature against the governor and executes the proposal through a **Handler**.

The Signature Bridge knows which handler to route and execute a proposal through using a mapping between **Resource Ids** and **Handlers**. This mapping lives on the **Signature Bridge**.

## Execution Handlers

The purpose of execution handlers is to parse an incoming proposal/message and call a function on a proxy smart contract. The flow looks like:

- Signature Bridge -> Execution Handler -> Execution Context

The Execution Handler knows which contract to interact with using a mapping between **Resource Ids** and **Execution Contexts**. This map lives on the respective **Handler**.

### Anchor Handler

The purpose of the Anchor Handler is to execute parameter updates for an Anchor contract.

Examples of parameters that we may want to update:

- The new `EdgeMetadata` for a neighboring anchor.
- The handler controlling the anchor.
- The verifier for the zero-knowledge proofs.

### Token Wrapper Handler

The purpose of the Token Wrapper Handler is to execute parameter updates for an Token Wrapper contract.

Examples of parameters that we may want to update:

- The fee for wrapping tokens.
- The tokens that are allowed to be wrapped.
- The amount of tokens one receives after wrapping.
- The handler controlling the token wrapper.

### Treasury Handler

The purpose of the Treasury Handler is to execute parameter updates for a Treasury contract.

Examples of parameters that we may want to update:

- The recipient of fees.
- The recipient of interest on the treasury.
- The handler controlling the treasury.

## Resource Ids

Resource IDs are identifiers of a target system and the chain that the target system lives on. Examples of these contains:

- The anchor contract address and the typed chain ID of the chain this contract is deployed on.
- The anchor merkle tree ID and the typed chain ID of the chain this pallet is deployed on.
- The token wrapper contract address and the typed chain ID of the chain this contract is deployed on.

Resource IDs are used in proposals that are sent to the DKG or any external signing/governance system. They are inserted into the proposal headers.

### Usage

When we create a new contract / target system that is meant to be controlled by the Signature Bridge we must first create its resource ID. This is straightforward to do, simply:

1. Take the contract's address / identify a numerical identifier for the storage instance (such as a tree ID).
2. Take the typed chain ID where this target system will live.
3. Concatenate these values in a 32-byte value.

#### Example

An example in Rust can be found [here](https://github.com/webb-tools/webb-rs/blob/main/proposals/src/header.rs#L215).

```rust
pub fn new(
    target_system: TargetSystem,
    typed_chain_id: TypedChainId,
) -> ResourceId {
    let mut bytes = [0u8; 32];
    let target_system_bytes: [u8; TargetSystem::LENGTH] =
        target_system.into();
    let f = 0;
    let t = TargetSystem::LENGTH;
    bytes[f..t].copy_from_slice(&target_system_bytes);
    let f = t;
    let t = t + TypedChainId::LENGTH;
    bytes[f..t].copy_from_slice(&typed_chain_id.into_bytes());
    Self(bytes)
}
```
